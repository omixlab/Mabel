    "text = \"Around 27% of South Americans live in central and southern Brazil. Of 19,400 human malaria cases in Brazil in 2018, some were from the southern and southeastern states. High abundance of malaria vectors is generally positively associated with malaria incidence. Expanding geographic distributions of Anopheles vector mosquito species (e.g. A. cruzii) in the face of climate change processes would increase risk of such malaria transmission; such risk is of particular concern in regions that hold human population concentrations near present limits of vector speciesâ€™ geographic distributions. We modeled effects of likely climate changes on the distribution of A. cruzii, evaluating two scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions for 2050, as simulated in 21 general circulation models and two greenhouse gas scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for 2050\""

       "\"In this passage, the focus is on the distribution and transmission of malaria in Brazil, specifically in the southern and southeastern states. It is mentioned that 27% of South Americans live in central and southern Brazil, which indicates a significant population concentration in these regions. Additionally, it states that out of the 19,400 human malaria cases in Brazil in 2018, some were from the southern and southeastern states.\\n\\nThe passage then discusses the relationship between the abundance of malaria vectors (specifically the Anopheles vector mosquito species, such as A. cruzii) and malaria incidence. It suggests that areas with a high abundance of these mosquito species are more likely to have a higher incidence of malaria.\\n\\nThe passage then introduces the concept of climate change and its potential impact on the distribution of A. cruzii. It states that climate change processes could cause the geographic distribution of this mosquito species to expand, increasing the risk of malaria transmission. This is of particular concern in regions where human population concentrations are already near the limits of the vector species' current distribution.\\n\\nTo assess the effects of climate change on the distribution of A. cruzii, the passage mentions that the researchers modeled two scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions for 2050. These scenarios were simulated using 21 general circulation models and two greenhouse gas scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for 2050. The purpose of this modeling exercise is likely to understand how climate change may affect the potential spread of malaria in the future, specifically in relation to the distribution of A. cruzii.\""
