Comparison of setup accuracy of optical surface image versus orthogonal x-ray images for VMAT of the left breast using deep-inspiration breath-hold.,"To compare the setup accuracy of optical surface image (OSI) versus orthogonal x-ray images (2DkV) using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) as ground truth for radiotherapy of left breast cancer in deep-inspiration breath-hold (DIBH). Ten left breast DIBH patients treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) were studied retrospectively. OSI, 2DkV, and CBCT were acquired weekly at treatment setup. OSI, 2DkV, and CBCT were registered to planning CT or planning DRR based on a breast surface region of interest (ROI), bony anatomy (chestwall and sternum), and both bony anatomy and breast surface, respectively. These registrations provided couch shifts for each imaging system. The setup errors, or the difference in couch shifts between OSI and CBCT were compared to those between 2DkV and CBCT. A second OSI was acquired during last beam delivery to evaluate intrafraction motion. The median absolute setup errors were (0.21, 0.27, 0.23 cm, 0.6°, 1.3°, 1.0°) for OSI, and (0.26, 0.24, 0.18 cm, 0.9°, 1.0°, 0.6°) for 2DkV in vertical, longitudinal and lateral translations, and in rotation, roll and pitch, respectively. None of the setup errors was significantly different between OSI and 2DkV. For both systems, the systematic and random setup errors were ≤0.6 cm and ≤1.5° in all directions. Nevertheless, larger setup errors were observed in some sessions in both systems. There was no correlation between OSI and CBCT whereas there was modest correlation between 2DkV and CBCT. The intrafraction motion in DIBH detected by OSI was small with median absolute translations <0.2 cm, and rotations ≤0.4°. Though OSI showed comparable and small setup errors as 2DkV, it showed no correlation with CBCT. We concluded that to achieve accurate setup for both bony anatomy and breast surface, daily 2DkV can't be omitted following OSI for left breast patients treated with DIBH VMAT.",e14117,Journal of applied clinical medical physics,Lu Wei; Hong Linda X; Yamada Nelson; Berry Sean L; Song Yulin; Choi Wookjin; Cerviño Laura I; Tang Xiaoli; Mechalakos James G; Romesser Paul B; Powell Simon; Li Guang; ,2023-08-03,Journal Article,10.1002/acm2.14117,"Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.;Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.;Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.;Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.;Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.;Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.;Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.;Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.;Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.;Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.;Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.;Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.",,,OSI
Avelumab vs Standard Second-Line Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer and Microsatellite Instability: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE
Only 1 randomized clinical trial has shown the superiority of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with deficient mismatch repair and/or microsatellite instability (dMMR/MSI) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the first-line setting.


OBJECTIVES
To determine whether avelumab (an anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 antibody) improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared with standard second-line chemotherapy in patients with dMMR/MSI mCRC.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
The SAMCO-PRODIGE 54 trial is a national open-label phase 2 randomized clinical trial that was conducted from April 24, 2018, to April 29, 2021, at 49 French sites. Patients with dMMR/MSI mCRC who experienced progression while receiving standard first-line therapy were included in the analysis.


INTERVENTIONS
Patients were randomized to receive standard second-line therapy or avelumab every 2 weeks until progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or patient refusal.


MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES
The primary end point was PFS according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours), version 1.1, evaluated by investigators in patients with mCRC and confirmed dMMR and MSI status who received at least 1 dose of treatment (modified intention-to-treat [mITT] population).


RESULTS
A total of 122 patients were enrolled in the mITT population. Median age was 66 (IQR, 56-76) years, 65 patients (53.3%) were women, 100 (82.0%) had a right-sided tumor, and 52 (42.6%) had BRAF V600E-mutated tumors. There was no difference in patients and tumor characteristics between treatment groups. No new safety concerns in either group were detected, with fewer treatment-related adverse events of at least grade 3 in the avelumab group than in the chemotherapy group (20 [31.7%] vs 34 [53.1%]; P = .02). After a median follow-up of 33.3 (95% CI, 28.3-34.8) months, avelumab was superior to chemotherapy with or without targeted agents with respect to PFS (15 [24.6%] vs 5 [8.2%] among patients without progression; P = .03). Rates of PFS rates at 12 months were 31.2% (95% CI, 20.1%-42.9%) and 19.4% (95% CI, 10.6%-30.2%) in the avelumab and control groups, respectively, and 27.4% (95% CI, 16.8%-39.0%) and 9.1% (95% CI, 3.2%-18.8%) at 18 months. Objective response rates were similar in both groups (18 [29.5%] vs 16 [26.2%]; P = .45). Among patients with disease control, 18 (75.7%) in the avelumab group compared with 9 (19.1%) in the control group had ongoing disease control at 18 months.


CONCLUSIONS
The SAMCO-PRODIGE 54 phase 2 randomized clinical trial showed, in patients with dMMR/MSI mCRC, better PFS and disease control duration with avelumab over standard second-line treatment, with a favorable safety profile.

Lipid Metabolic Regulatory Crosstalk Between Cancer Cells and Tumor-Associated Macrophages.,"In the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are one of the most abundant cell populations, playing key roles in tumorigenesis, chemoresistance, immune evasion, and metastasis. There is an important interaction between TAMs and cancer cells: on the one hand, tumors control the function of infiltrating macrophages, contributing to reprogramming of TAMs, and on the other hand, TAMs affect the growth of cancer cells. This review focuses on lipid metabolism changes in the complex relationship between cancer cells and TAMs. We discuss how lipid metabolism in cancer cells affects macrophage phenotypic and metabolic changes and, subsequently, how altered lipid metabolism of TAMs influences tumor progression. Identifying the metabolic changes that influence the complex interaction between tumor cells and TAMs is also an important step in exploring new therapeutic approaches that target metabolic reprogramming of immune cells to enhance their tumoricidal potential and bypass therapy resistance. Our work may provide new targets for antitumor therapies.",,DNA and cell biology,Liu Shu; Shen Ying Ying; Yin Li Yang; Liu Jianghua; Zu Xuyu; ,2023-08-03,Journal Article,10.1089/dna.2023.0071,"Cancer Research Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.;Cancer Research Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.;Cancer Research Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.;Department of Metabolism and Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.;Cancer Research Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.",,,

Neoadjuvant Camrelizumab Plus Platinum-Based Chemotherapy vs Chemotherapy Alone for Chinese Patients With Resectable Stage IIIA or IIIB (T3N2) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The TD-FOREKNOW Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE
The benefit of neoadjuvant camrelizumab plus chemotherapy for resectable stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown.


OBJECTIVE
To assess the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant camrelizumab plus chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone for patients with resectable stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
In this randomized phase 2 clinical trial conducted at 2 hospitals in China, patients aged 18 to 70 years with resectable stage IIIA or IIIB (T3N2) NSCLC were enrolled between April 7, 2020, and January 12, 2022.


INTERVENTIONS
Patients were randomly assigned to receive 3 cycles of camrelizumab (200 mg) plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, 130 mg/m2, and platinum [cisplatin, 75 mg/m2; carboplatin, area under the curve, 5; or nedaplatin, 100 mg/m2]) or chemotherapy alone, followed by surgery after 4 to 6 weeks.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
The primary end point was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. Secondary end points included the major pathologic response (MPR) rate, objective response rate (ORR), event-free survival (EFS), and safety. Disease-free survival (DFS, defined as the time from surgery to disease recurrence or death from any cause) was analyzed post hoc. Efficacy was assessed on a modified intention-to-treat basis.


RESULTS
Ninety-four Chinese patients were randomized, and 88 (93.6%; median age, 61 years [IQR, 54-65 years]; 74 men [84.1%]) received allocated neoadjuvant treatment (43 received camrelizumab plus chemotherapy, and 45 received chemotherapy alone). Among these 88 patients, the pCR rate was 32.6% (14 of 43; 95% CI, 19.1%-48.5%) with camrelizumab plus chemotherapy vs 8.9% (4 of 45; 95% CI, 2.5%-21.2%) with chemotherapy alone (odds ratio, 4.95; 95% CI, 1.35-22.37; P = .008). The MPR rates were 65.1% (95% CI, 49.1%-79.0%) with camrelizumab plus chemotherapy and 15.6% (95% CI, 6.5%-29.5%) with chemotherapy alone. The radiographic ORRs were 72.1% (95% CI, 56.3%-84.7%) with camrelizumab plus chemotherapy and 53.3% (95% CI, 37.9%-68.3%) with chemotherapy alone. With a median follow-up of 14.1 months (IQR, 9.2-20.9 months), the median EFS and DFS were not reached in either group. The most common neoadjuvant treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were decreased white blood cell count (6 of 43 [14.0%] in the camrelizumab plus chemotherapy group vs 2 of 45 [4.4%] in the chemotherapy group) and decreased neutrophil count (3 of 43 [7.0%] in the camrelizumab plus chemotherapy group vs 5 of 45 [11.1%] in the chemotherapy group). No treatment-related deaths were reported.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
This randomized clinical trial found that among patients with resectable stage IIIA or IIIB (T3N2) NSCLC, camrelizumab plus chemotherapy, compared with chemotherapy alone, significantly improved the pCR rate with manageable toxic effects.

Critical Appraisal of Guideline Recommendations on Systemic Therapies for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Review.,"IMPORTANCE
The combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with antiangiogenic agents has revolutionized the treatment landscape of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, due to rapid publication of new studies that attained their predefined primary end points, a lack of robust cross-trial comparison of first-line therapies, and diverging clinical guidelines, no clear-cut treatment flowchart and sequence of therapies are available. This critical analysis of the recommendations for the management of advanced HCC from the main scientific societies in the US and Europe adopted an integrated approach to provide information on the clinical benefit (overall survival and progression-free survival) and safety profile of these therapies using the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (MCBS) score and an ad hoc network meta-analysis.


OBSERVATIONS
There is a major consensus among guidelines that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab has a primacy as the recommended first-line treatment of choice in advanced HCC. On progression after immunotherapy-containing regimens and for patients with contraindications for immunotherapies, most guidelines maintain the established treatment hierarchy, recommending lenvatinib or sorafenib as the preferred options, followed by either regorafenib, cabozantinib, or ramucirumab. Thus far, the first-line immune-based regimen of tremelimumab plus durvulumab has been integrated only in the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidance document and the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and is recommended for patients with a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Overall, in the first-line setting, both atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and sintilimab plus IBI305 (a bevacizumab biosimilar) received the highest ESMO-MCBS score of 5, indicating a substantial magnitude of clinical benefit. In a network meta-analysis, no significant differences in overall survival were found among the various combination regimens. However, the newly reported combination of camrelizumab plus rivoceranib was associated with a significantly higher risk of treatment-related adverse events compared with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (relative risk, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.25-2.03; P < .001).


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
This narrative review found that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is regarded as the primary standard of care for advanced HCC in the first-line setting. These findings from integrating the recommendations from scientific societies' guidelines for managing advanced HCC along with new data from cross-trial comparisons may aid clinicians in decision-making and guide them through a rapidly evolving and complex treatment landscape.",,JAMA oncology,Cappuyns Sarah; Corbett Virginia; Yarchoan Mark; Finn Richard S; Llovet Josep M; ,2023-08-03,Journal Article,10.1001/jamaoncol.2023.2677,"Mount Sinai Liver Cancer Program, Division of Liver Diseases, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.;Mount Sinai Liver Cancer Program, Division of Liver Diseases, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.;Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.;Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles), Los Angeles.;Mount Sinai Liver Cancer Program, Division of Liver Diseases, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.",,,
